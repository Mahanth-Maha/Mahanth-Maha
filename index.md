## Portfolio

- Password Manager App [Latest Release](https://github.com/Mahanth-Maha/PswdMngrAL/releases/tag/v1.2)

> A Automated Software which stores mail/User id and Password with encryption and manages to auto login into the website by fetching respective password. I used standard encryption algorithms such as RSA,SHA-256 and AES and stored passwords in Database with SQLite using SQL as Cipher text which makes it more secure. I used some salt to protect it even further, Simple security but quite unbreakable.

> Encryption : RSA & SHA-256 – Master Password , AES – individual site passwords
